# AI Human Evolutionary Dynamics Research

Research project exploring parallels between human species replacement patterns and potential AI-human dynamics.

## 🎯 Purpose
- Track and version prompts for consistent AI model testing
- Crowdsource prompt improvements  
- Collect and analyze responses across different AI models
- Build evidence base for evolutionary parallel hypothesis

## 🧬 The Hypothesis
Just as Homo sapiens didn't deliberately exterminate other human species but outcompeted them through superior capabilities, advanced AI systems might not need malicious intent to dramatically alter human dominance. This research explores whether competitive displacement patterns from human evolution might parallel potential AI-human dynamics.

## 🚀 Quick Start
