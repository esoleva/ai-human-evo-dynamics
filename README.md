# AI Human Evolutionary Dynamics Research

Research project exploring parallels between human species replacement patterns and potential AI-human dynamics.

# Context

I was watching a movie called [The Creator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Creator_(2023_film)) and one of the movie characters had this line about how the Homo Sapiens lead to the extinction of the Neanderthals because they were a more advanced species.

That movie line lead me to this chat with Claude 4 Sonnet [genesis_evolution_discussion_transcript.md](/prompts/versions/experimental/step-by-step-prompts/genesis_evolution_discussion_transcript.md).

Then I thought - I wonder if others will get the same results as me. 
Also, I wonder what other LLM models might respond with.
So, I created this repo to organize the research aroung this topic.

## 🎯 Purpose
- Track and version prompts for consistent AI model testing
- Crowdsource prompt improvements  
- Collect and analyze responses across different AI models
- Build evidence base for evolutionary parallel hypothesis

## 🧬 The Hypothesis
Just as Homo sapiens didn't deliberately exterminate other human species but outcompeted them through superior capabilities, advanced AI systems might not need malicious intent to dramatically alter human dominance. This research explores whether competitive displacement patterns from human evolution might parallel potential AI-human dynamics.
