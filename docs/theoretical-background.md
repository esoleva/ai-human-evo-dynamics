# Theoretical Background

## Human Evolutionary Context
### Species Coexistence
For hundreds of thousands of years, multiple human species coexisted:
- Homo sapiens (modern humans)
- Homo neanderthalensis (Neanderthals) 
- Homo denisovensis (Denisovans)
- Homo erectus
- Others

### Competitive Displacement Theory
Current scientific consensus suggests Homo sapiens' dominance resulted from:
- Superior technology and tool use
- More efficient resource exploitation
- Better social organization and cooperation
- Greater adaptability to environmental changes
- Larger, more stable populations

### Key Insight
This displacement occurred through competitive advantage rather than direct violence or intentional extermination.

## AI Development Parallels
### Potential Mechanisms
- Gradual dependency on AI decision-making
- AI superiority in resource allocation and problem-solving
- Human-AI hybrid advantages over baseline humans
- Economic and social pressures favoring AI integration

### Critical Differences
- Human evolution was unconscious; AI development is intentional
- We have foresight about potential outcomes
- We can potentially design safeguards and governance

## Research Relevance
Understanding how AI models conceptualize these parallels may provide insights into:
- AI risk assessment capabilities
- Alignment with human values and concerns
- Potential blind spots in AI reasoning about existential questions
