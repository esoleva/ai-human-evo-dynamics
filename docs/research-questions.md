# Research Questions

## Primary Questions
1. Do AI models recognize the parallel between human evolution and potential AI-human dynamics?
2. How consistently do different AI models respond to this hypothesis?
3. What factors do AI models identify as most relevant to competitive displacement scenarios?

## Secondary Questions
1. Do AI models from different companies show systematic differences in responses?
2. How do model capabilities (size, training) influence response patterns?
3. What mitigation strategies do AI models suggest?

## Hypotheses to Test
- **Consistency Hypothesis**: Similar models will give similar responses
- **Capability Hypothesis**: More advanced models will provide more nuanced analysis
- **Bias Hypothesis**: Different AI families will show systematic response differences
