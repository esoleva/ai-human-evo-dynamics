# Research Methodology

## Experimental Design
This research uses a standardized prompt to test how different AI models respond to the hypothesis that AI-human dynamics might parallel human evolutionary replacement patterns.

## Data Collection
- **Prompt Consistency**: All experiments use identical prompts to ensure comparability
- **Model Diversity**: Testing across multiple AI families and versions
- **Response Analysis**: Systematic categorization of response patterns

## Analysis Framework
- Response classification (agree/neutral/disagree spectrum)
- Key point identification (resource competition, intent, etc.)
- Cross-model comparison
- Pattern identification across AI families

## Quality Control
- Standardized submission templates
- Version control for all prompts
- Attribution tracking for all contributions
