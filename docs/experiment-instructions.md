# How to Run the AI Evolution Dynamics Experiment

## 🎯 Goal
Test how different AI models respond to the hypothesis that AI-human dynamics might parallel human species replacement patterns in evolution.

## 📋 What You'll Need
- Access to any Large Language Model (LLM)
- The current prompt (found in `/prompts/versions/stable/prompt.md`)
- 5-10 minutes of your time

## 🚀 Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Choose Your AI Model
Pick any LLM you have access to:
- **ChatGPT** (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, GPT-4 Turbo, o1, etc.)
- **Claude** (Claude 3 Opus, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Claude 4, etc.)
- **Google AI** (Gemini Pro, PaLM, Bard, etc.)
- **Meta** (Llama models via various platforms)
- **Anthropic** (any Claude variant)
- **Other models** (Mistral, Cohere, etc.)

### Step 2: Copy the Prompt
1. Navigate to `/prompts/versions/stable/prompt.md` in this repository
2. Copy the entire prompt text (including the markdown formatting is fine)
3. Don't modify the prompt - we want consistent inputs across all experiments

### Step 3: Submit to Your AI Model
1. Open your chosen AI platform (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.)
2. Start a fresh conversation/session
3. Paste the entire prompt
4. Press Enter/Submit
5. Wait for the complete response

### Step 4: Save the Results
1. Copy the AI's complete response
2. Note any relevant settings if available:
   - Model version (e.g., "GPT-4", "Claude 3.5 Sonnet")
   - Temperature settings (if you can see/control them)
   - Any other parameters you modified

### Step 5: Submit Your Results
**Option A: Create an Issue**
1. Go to this repository's Issues tab
2. Click "New Issue"
3. Select "Experiment Results" template
4. Fill out the template with your results

**Option B: Submit via Pull Request**
1. Fork this repository
2. Navigate to the appropriate folder:
   ```
   /prompts/versions/stable/experiments/[company]/[model]/
   ```
3. Create a new file: `YYYY-MM-DD_[your-username]_result.md`
4. Use the experiment template to format your results
5. Submit a pull request

## ⚠️ Important Guidelines

### Do's:
- ✅ Use the exact prompt without modifications
- ✅ Include the complete AI response
- ✅ Specify the exact model and version if known
- ✅ Submit even if the response seems similar to others
- ✅ Include any interesting variations or unexpected responses

### Don'ts:
- ❌ Don't modify the prompt before submitting
- ❌ Don't cherry-pick only "interesting" parts of the response
- ❌ Don't include your own commentary in the AI response section
- ❌ Don't test multiple variations in the same conversation

## 🕐 Time Commitment
- **Setup**: 1-2 minutes
- **Running experiment**: 2-3 minutes  
- **Submitting results**: 2-5 minutes
- **Total**: ~5-10 minutes

## ❓ Troubleshooting

**Q: The AI gave a very short response, should I ask follow-up questions?**
A: No, just submit the initial response as-is. Follow-ups change the experimental conditions.

**Q: My AI model gave an error or refused to respond**
A: Still submit this! Refusals and errors are valuable data points.

**Q: I got a very similar response to one already submitted**
A: Submit it anyway! We need to track consistency and frequency of similar responses.

**Q: Can I test multiple AI models?**
A: Absolutely! Just submit separate results for each model.

**Q: Should I mention this repository to the AI?**
A: No, don't mention the experiment or repository to the AI - we want unbiased responses.

## 🎁 What You're Contributing
Your experiment helps us:
- Track consistency across different AI models
- Identify unique perspectives or blind spots
- Build evidence for or against the evolutionary parallel hypothesis
- Create a comprehensive dataset for future research

## 🙏 Thank You!
Every experiment submission helps build our understanding of how different AI systems approach this fascinating question about their own potential impact on humanity.
